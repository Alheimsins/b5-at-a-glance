    "shortDescription": "Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct our impulses.",
    "description": "Impulses are not inherently bad;\noccasionally time constraints require a snap decision, and acting on\nour first impulse can be an effective response. Also, in times of\nplay rather than work, acting spontaneously and impulsively can be\nfun. Impulsive individuals can be seen by others as colorful,\nfun-to-be-with, and zany.\nNonetheless, acting on impulse can lead to trouble in a number of\nways. Some impulses are antisocial. Uncontrolled antisocial acts\nnot only harm other members of society, but also can result in\nretribution toward the perpetrator of such impulsive acts. Another\nproblem with impulsive acts is that they often produce immediate\nrewards but undesirable, long-term consequences. Examples include\nexcessive socializing that leads to being fired from one's job,\nhurling an insult that causes the breakup of an important\nrelationship, or using pleasure-inducing drugs that eventually\ndestroy one's health.\nImpulsive behavior, even when not seriously destructive, diminishes\na person's effectiveness in significant ways. Acting impulsively\ndisallows contemplating alternative courses of action, some of which\nwould have been wiser than the impulsive choice. Impulsivity also\nsidetracks people during projects that require organized sequences\nof steps or stages. Accomplishments of an impulsive person are\ntherefore small, scattered, and inconsistent.\nA hallmark of intelligence, what potentially separates human beings\nfrom earlier life forms, is the ability to think about future\nconsequences before acting on an impulse. Intelligent activity\ninvolves contemplation of long-range goals, organizing and planning\nroutes to these goals, and persisting toward one's goals in the face\nof short-lived impulses to the contrary. The idea that intelligence\ninvolves impulse control is nicely captured by the term prudence, an\nalternative label for the Conscientiousness domain. Prudent means\nboth wise and cautious. Persons who score high on the\nConscientiousness scale are, in fact, perceived by others as intelligent.\nThe benefits of high conscientiousness are obvious. Conscientious\nindividuals avoid trouble and achieve high levels of success through\npurposeful planning and persistence. They are also positively\nregarded by others as intelligent and reliable. On the negative\nside, they can be compulsive perfectionists and workaholics.\nFurthermore, extremely conscientious individuals might be regarded\nas stuffy and boring.
